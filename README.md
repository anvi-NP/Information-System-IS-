 Its just a basic websites desgin.
 You can use it as reference for learning.
 Now,We uses AI Tools for creating web-pages which uses LLM for its operatins(I am from Artificial Intelligence Faculty for your Information) . This project was build for my Coursework submission but for me its was to know the flow of its working mechanism which i got it. 
 Now, I can create fully AI based Automation E-commerce platform with the help of robotics for Ware House product or order management. 
 Its a large project where rather than software hardware is given more priority. Its beyond your imagination i am writing about technology of level-7 where in nepal level 3 max is possible and this is not even 1% of level 1.
 The process is long if anyone of u interested please feel free to contact at my email. This approach hold business person mindset.
